Filling out payday loan applications is often seen as a last ditch effort to right financial wrongs. Some people view the fast cash advance opportunities as getting caught up in predatory lending schemes, but these folks tend to be the ones who have needed a last ditch attempt for emergency cash. When living in a home with a decent income or tow to support cost of living expenses, it's tough to wrap your head around the notion that there are people out there who cannot even afford a bank account, never mind to make ends meet.

Too many Americans live without bank accounts, live on less than supportive income or unreliable money opportunities. They adapt to whatever means needed to make their finances work. For those with income, the thought of payday loans online or from a storefront could be the difference between food on the table or going hungry. Stories like these do not make the payday lenders out to be bad guys, but rather an alternative option for those who cannot wait until their next payday. It by no means glorifies the loans as being good. They are expensive, but at least they are an option. Take these loans away and these people will find other means to provide for their families. There may be lots of judgments made against the new alternative way to obtain cash. People who live in this situation live in a financial cycle of doom; the direct payday lender is not the culprit.
